# Community & Ecosystem

We welcome contributors who align with the five core principles in
[docs/OPERATIONAL_PHILOSOPHY.md](OPERATIONAL_PHILOSOPHY.md). The goal is a
privacy-first, local-first ecosystem without feature creep.

## Where to Engage

- **GitHub Issues**: bugs, proposals, and enhancement requests.
- **GitHub Discussions**: design threads, migration questions, and playbooks.

> If Discussions aren’t enabled yet, open an issue requesting activation.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Keep the core deterministic, local-first, and opt-in for risky features.
- Prefer modular add-ons for multi-agent planning, scheduling, and cost routing.
- Every new feature should answer the five questions in the feature request template.

## Example Workflows

- Audit-friendly agent flow
- Sandbox-only code execution
- Local receipts + boundary verification demo

See [examples/README.md](../examples/README.md) for starter workflows.
