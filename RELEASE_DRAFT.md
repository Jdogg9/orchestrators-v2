# 🚀 V2.0 Stable: The Sovereign Orchestration Release

> "Auditable, Deterministic, and Privacy-First."

This release marks the transition from reference architecture to production-hardened infrastructure. By placing **Token Density** at the center of the safety model, V2.0 eliminates the 'black box' ambiguity typical of agentic systems.

### 💎 Key Features
- **Deterministic Tiered Reasoning**: Automatic model selection based on context pressure (Tier 1 < 4k | Tier 2 32k | Tier 3 32k+).
- **Priority-Aware Pruning**: Never lose your System Prompt or Initial Goal again. The orchestrator now surgically trims mid-turn noise to fit the $16,384$ token cognitive budget.
- **Audit-Grade Trace Receipts**: Every trace now includes `token_usage` metrics (input/output/utilization %) for sub-millisecond accountability.
- **Local-First Tokenization**: Integrated `ORCH_TOKENIZER` package with byte-level fallback.

### 🛠 Security & Compliance
- **Boundary Verified**: Confirmed zero leakage of secrets or runtime state via `verify_public_boundary.sh`.
- **Zero-Trust Defaults**: All telemetry is OTel-compatible and local-only by default.
